Creating a Reader
=================

Thw following notebook illustrates the complete end-to-end process for developing a ``Reader`` for ``SciFiReaders``. It walks the reader through:

1. exploring the nature of the proprietary data file
2. extracting metadata (parameters)
3. extracting axes, and the raw data
4. incorporating these information into a ``sidpy.Dataset`` object
5. the construction of a ``Reader`` class using the code from the above steps
